Features that need to be added
- TestMode should select the control interface that is created. Add once proper drone interfacing is working.
- Update flight data when a flight is selected, and when the flights are loaded. Maybe placeholder for loading single flight?


Current work -
- Develop the map system, based off of flight data.
- Update the flight system properly with REST calling.
