Features that need to be added
- TestMode should select the control interface that is created. Add once proper drone interfacing is working.
- Update flight data when a flight is selected, and when the flights are loaded. Maybe placeholder for loading single flight?

Immediate tasks - 
Add flight selection to the calibration page (top option).
Update flight system to have payload location options.
Telemetry saving and review.
Overhaul systems to make sure that data updating and logic is ready for drone connection.

Current work -
- Develop the map system, based off of flight data.
- Update the flight system properly with REST calling.
