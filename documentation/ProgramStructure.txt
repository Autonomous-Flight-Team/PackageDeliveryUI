There are three services that run.
These are -
    Telemetry
    Command
    GUI

The GUI thread manages the JavaFX display components, and interface interaction. This should never be interupted.
The Telemetry thread manages requesting drone telemetry, if connected, every 10th of a second.
The Command thread manages sending commands to the drone, that the GUI calls.

There are intermediate classes that these threads access.
These are -
    Data
    Control

All threads can access data normally, but must use Platform.runLater to set data, in order to maintain thread safety.
All threads can access control normally, but only Command and Data should be running control functions, as only they are directly acessing dron data.
The GUI should send commands and get info from data.
The Command thread should run control functions and update data accordingly.
The Telemetry thread should run control functions and update data accordingly.

The GUI will be bound to the data properties, and will thus not need to actively update when data changes.
