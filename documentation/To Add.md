- Better number/string validation/restriction for input fields and settings. More feedback should be given to the user if
their input doesn't match the requirement (ie a string in the port field) than just not doing anything until it is fixed.
This could be done with a notification system and a try catch on entering input, an extension of the InputField, or some styling
of the textfield to match the input provided with events of some sort. Low priority.
